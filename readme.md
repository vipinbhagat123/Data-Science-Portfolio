# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and R markdown files (published at RPubs).   
    
For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out [vipinbhagat.com](http://vipinbhagat.com) _(coming soon)_.

 
_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under the `data` directory) is for demonstration purposes only._
 
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. Run notebooks using a Jupyter notebook server, VS Code, or another platform.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/vipinbhagat123/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/vipinbhagat123/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Tested different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, identifying likely donors for a fictional non-profit organization.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/vipinbhagat123/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzed customer data to discover internal structure, patterns, and knowledge using unsupervised learning techniques.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/vipinbhagat123/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Developed a Q-Learning driving agent that navigates a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/vipinbhagat123/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb): Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data from the MNIST dataset.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing
